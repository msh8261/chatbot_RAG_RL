Example of Hallucination
User: Who won the FIFA World Cup in 2030?
LLM (hallucination): Brazil won the 2030 FIFA World Cup.
‚ö†Ô∏è Reality: The 2030 World Cup hasn‚Äôt happened yet!

Mitigation Strategies
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): Use real-time knowledge bases for factual accuracy.
Fine-Tuning & Reinforcement Learning: Train on verified datasets and penalize hallucinations.
Fact-Checking Systems: Integrate external verification tools (e.g., Google Search, Wikipedia).
2. Data Leakage in AI & ML
Data leakage occurs when a model unintentionally learns patterns from data it shouldn‚Äôt have access to. This leads to overfitting and unrealistic performance in training but poor real-world results.

Types of Data Leakage
Training-Testing Leakage:

The model sees test data during training, leading to inflated accuracy.
Example: If a fraud detection model is trained on transaction records that contain labels derived from future data, it will predict fraud unrealistically well.
Feature Leakage:

A model is trained with a feature that is not available during real-world inference.
Example: If a hospital‚Äôs AI uses ‚Äúdischarge date‚Äù to predict whether a patient will recover, it won‚Äôt work in real-time because discharge happens after recovery.
Unintentional Leakage via Preprocessing:

Leaking future information during feature engineering (e.g., using statistics calculated from the full dataset instead of just the training set).
How to Prevent Data Leakage?
Strict Data Splitting: Ensure training, validation, and test sets are truly independent.
Time-Based Partitioning: If working with time-series data, use past data for training and future data for testing.
Feature Selection Review: Ensure that all features available in training will also be available in deployment.
Cross-Validation: Use techniques like k-fold CV to detect overfitting due to leakage.
Final Thoughts
Hallucination affects LLMs, making them generate plausible but false outputs.
Data Leakage affects ML models, leading to over-optimistic training performance but poor generalization.
Both issues reduce model reliability and must be actively mitigated!
